								<h3>Ana Guerberof-Arenas was invited as keynote speaker in Geneve</h3>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/Keynote.jpeg" alt="Keynote" /></span>The International Federation of Translators XXIII World Congress took place in Geneva from 4th to 6th September. INCREC project PI, Prof Ana Guerberof Arenas, was invited as a keynote speaker to this event that is celebrated every three years by the federation. Her keynote, INCREC project: creative process in translation and the user experience, examined how creativity is conceptualised in the social sciences and in translation studies, as well as its relationship with technology. Throughout the talk, she presented results from different studies carried out under the CREAMT project (2020-2022) and the new INCREC research project (2023-2028), which investigates the creative process of professional literary and audiovisual translators in order to create specific taxonomies on that process, and to explore whether the use of technology, e.g. machine translation, can be advantageous or limit creativity.
